# Inspiration

Inspired by Jonas Welticke's [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/gfve7yYCS08?si=GwQnU73gCRLuBu-B).

Games data collected from [Archive](https://archive.org/details/ogs2021).

# Modes

- **Continue / Restart / About** remain the primary home actions. Hitting **Continue** now returns to the mode picker so you can explicitly resume either **Position** (classic board snapshot) or **Sequence** (moves replay stone by stone).
- **Position** shows the final arrangement for the current level, just as before.
- **Sequence** plays each move in order and shows captures live before settling on the target board for the memorization phase.
